# Schema Processor Core Processors PRD

> **Note**: This PRD depends on the [Schema Foundation PRD](./1-schema-foundation.md.yml) which must be completed first. See that PRD for Overview, Background, Research Findings, and Architecture sections.

This PRD covers Phases 2, 3, and 4 of the schema processor refactoring: creating core processor plugins and refactoring existing service methods to use them.

## Overview

Create schema processor plugins for entity display features, field features, and field definition processing. Refactor existing service methods in `design_system/src/EntityDisplay.php`, `bd/src/Field/FieldSchemaProcessor.php`, and `bd/src/Entity/EntityFieldHelper.php` to use `SchemaProcessorManager` instead of custom service methods.

## Reference to Foundation PRD

For detailed schema definitions, implementation specifications, and design patterns, see:

- Section 2: Create Schema Processor Plugins - Generic processor consolidation strategy

### Entity Type Config Processing (EntityHelper module)


**Current Implementation**: Complex 440+ line method that processes `bd.entity_type.*` config entities through multiple transformation steps.

**Complete Normalization Steps Analysis** (in execution order):


**All Processing Steps Identified**:

1. **Config Loading** (lines 650-678) - Load `bd.entity_type.*` configs from database (preserved, outside processors)
2. **Template Separation** (lines 687-703) - Separate templates from regular entity types
3. **Definition Dismounting** (lines 707-710) - Convert entity type objects to arrays (preserved, outside processors)
4. **Definition Addition** (lines 712-759) - Add new entity type definitions with validation and merging
5. **Bundle Entity Type Creation** (lines 761-795) - Create bundle entity types from templates
6. **Base Merging (Templates)** (lines 797-802) - Merge base templates recursively
7. **Base Merging (Regular)** (lines 804-810) - Merge base entity types/templates recursively
8. **Handler Merging** (lines 812-823) - Merge `settings.handlers` into top-level `handlers`
9. **Tag Attachment** (line 825) - Apply standard tags
10. **Alter Processing** (lines 827-866) - Process alter configs (by ID or tag-based subset)
11. **Link Default Processing** (lines 868-883) - Set default canonical/collection paths
12. **Bundle Link Processing** (lines 886-903) - Set bundle entity type collection paths
13. **Tag-Based Config Derivation** (lines 905-932) - Derive config from tags (admin tag handling)
14. **Variable Replacement** (lines 934-987) - Two-pass variable replacement
15. **Link Template Mapping** (line 993) - Apply schema-driven link template mappings
16. **Translation Processing** (lines 995-1017) - Wrap strings in TranslatableMarkup/PluralTranslation
17. **Sorting** (line 1020) - Alphabetically sort entity types (preserved, outside processors)
18. **Handler Cleanup** (lines 1025-1032) - Clean up handlers array
19. **Label Wrapping** (line 1035) - Wrap label properties in TranslatableMarkup
20. **Entity Keys Cleanup** (lines 1042-1054) - Clean up entity_keys with defaults
21. **Storage Handler Setting** (lines 1056-1060) - Set custom storage handler for entity_type
22. **Object Mounting** (lines 1062-1077) - Convert arrays to ContentEntityType/ConfigEntityType objects (preserved, outside processors)

**Processing Complexity**: The method handles multiple concerns (inheritance, merging, transformation, validation) that could benefit from processor-based architecture.

### Computed Field Config Processing (EntityFieldHelper module)


**Current Implementation**: Method processes `computed_field` entities during `hook_entity_bundle_field_info_alter()` to create bundle field definitions.


**Complete Processing Steps Analysis** (in execution order):


**All Processing Steps Identified**:

1. **Entity Type Validation** (lines 508-512) - Check if `computed_field` entity type exists (preserved, outside processors)
2. **Entity Loading** (lines 514-519) - Load computed_field entities by entity_type and bundle (preserved, outside processors)
3. **Entity Iteration** (line 530) - Loop through each computed_field entity (preserved, outside processors)
4. **Plugin Field Type Extraction** (lines 532-538) - Extract `plugin_field_type['plugin_id']` → field_type
5. **Plugin Computed Field Extraction** (lines 533, 539-540) - Extract `plugin_computed_field['plugin_id']` and `plugin_config`
6. **ID Parsing** (lines 534-537) - Parse computed_field_id (`{entity_type}.{bundle}.{field_name}`) to extract field_name
7. **Field Definition Creation** (line 545) - Create BaseFieldDefinition with field_type

10. **Computed Flag Setting** (line 551) - Set computed(TRUE) on field
11. **Display Configurable Setting** (line 552) - Set display configurable for view
12. **Field Identity Setting** (lines 553-554) - Set name and target entity type
13. **Cardinality Setting** (lines 556-557) - Set cardinality (default 1 if not set)
14. **Class Mapping** (lines 559-612) - Map field_type to ComputedFieldItemList class using static mapping
15. **Class Setting** (line 614) - Set class on field definition
16. **Field Addition** (line 616) - Add field to fields array (preserved, outside processors)

**Processing Complexity**: The method handles plugin instance format extraction, field definition creation, class mapping, and settings configuration that could benefit from processor-based architecture.

### 2. Create Schema Processor Plugins

**Consolidation Strategy**: This PRD uses a combination of generic configurable processors and specialized processors. Generic processors (Section 1.11) handle common patterns through configuration, reducing the total plugin count from 54 to approximately 20-25 processors while maintaining full functionality. Specialized processors are retained for complex operations that don't fit generic patterns.

**Generic Processor Consolidations**:
- **Property Setter Processor** (Section 1.11.1): Replaces 10 specialized processors (FormTitleProcessor, FormDescriptionProcessor, FormHelpTextProcessor, ComputedFieldPropertiesProcessor, ComputedFieldFlagProcessor, ComputedFieldDisplayConfigurableProcessor, ComputedFieldCardinalityProcessor, ComputedFieldIdentityProcessor, EntityTypeLabelWrapProcessor, EntityTypeEntityKeysProcessor)
- **Merge Processor** (Section 1.11.2): Replaces 5 specialized processors (EntityTypeBaseMergeProcessor, EntityTypeHandlerMergeProcessor, EntityTypeAlterProcessor, FieldSettingsMergeProcessor, EntityTypeBundleCreationProcessor)
- **Plugin Instance Extractor Processor** (Section 1.11.3): Replaces 2 specialized processors (ComputedFieldPluginTypeExtractorProcessor, ComputedFieldPluginExtractorProcessor)
- **Field Definition Processor** (Section 1.11.4): Replaces 3 specialized processors (BaseFieldDefinitionProcessor, ComputedFieldDefinitionCreatorProcessor, FieldTemplateProcessor)
- **Cleanup Processor** (Section 1.11.5): Replaces 2 specialized processors (EntityTypeHandlerCleanupProcessor, EntityTypeEntityKeysProcessor)
- **Link Processor** (Section 1.11.6): Replaces 3 specialized processors (EntityTypeLinkDefaultProcessor, EntityTypeBundleLinkProcessor, EntityTypeLinkTemplateProcessor)
- **Tag Processor** (Section 1.11.7): Replaces 2 specialized processors (EntityTypeTagProcessor, EntityTypeTagDerivationProcessor)

**Total Consolidation**: 27 specialized processors → 7 generic processors (reduction of 20 plugins, ~37% reduction in total processor count)

#### Entity Display Processors (11 plugins → 8 specialized + 1 generic)

**Note**: FormTitleProcessor, FormDescriptionProcessor, and FormHelpTextProcessor are replaced by Property Setter Processor (Section 1.11.1) with appropriate configuration.

1-3. **Property Setter Processor** (generic, Section 1.11.1) - Replaces FormTitleProcessor, FormDescriptionProcessor, FormHelpTextProcessor
